/**
 *  A HashSet implementation that buffers modifications until a commit
 *  is performeed.  The buffering can be done from one thread and the
 *  reads from another.  So reads are safe from any thread but writes
 *  must be done from only one thread or properly synchronized externally.
 *  This is useful for efficiently buffering the output of one process
 *  for another.
 *
 *  Note: this doubles the storage requirements over a typical HashSet
 *  is it internally keeps two sets, one for the writer and one for all
 *  readers.
 *
 *  Also note: the semantics of the way reads and writes are decoupled
 *  mean that it is possible for add(element) to return false (indicating
 *  that the set already has the value) while contains(element) will also
 *  return false (because the element hasn't been committed yet).  The
 *  writing thread should use getTransaction() if it wants to check 
 *  transactional data integrity for some reason.
